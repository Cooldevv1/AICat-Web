# AICat Repository
AICat is the leading AI Chatbot for the Roblox game, CatWeb. This chatbot is not endorsed nor made by HumanCat222 or any CatWeb staff and is therefore a community project.

This repo is linked to the AICat website and therefore some files are closed source. This is due to many security reasons as we don't want to share API keys or leak user account data. Please help us by contributing to the source code listed here on GitHub.
